# STOCK-API

![Brian Sanchez](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4729145-dc82-4178-af9d-275b0195966b)

For this project I chose the following stocks: 
- Chipotle
- Apple
- Starbucks
- Home Depot
- Nike

Each stock has its own corresponding information such as MEDIAN MODE & MEAN.
Each stock has its own graph and data loaded under a pandas dataclass.
